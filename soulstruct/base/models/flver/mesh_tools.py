class MergedMesh:
    """Holds data for a single merged FLVER mesh created from all its submeshes. Optimized for Blender meshes.

    The merging operation identifes all unique vertices across all submeshes - as defined by their position, bone
    weights, and bone indices - and creates reduced 'vertex arrays' of these data for the entire mesh. Other data
    defined by FLVER vertices are moved to 'loop arrays', as well as the indices of the new reduced vertices they use.
    Each face indexes the loops it uses, as well as the material and vertex buffer layout it uses from the FLVER
    (unchanged indices from the submesh).

    NOTE: Bone indices will be remapped to global bone indices from `submesh.bone_indices` if present. The submesh will
    not be modified and `submesh.bone_indices` will not be cleared.

    Also has the options to discard degenerate (line/point) faces and/or duplicate faces (same three vertex indices in
    any order) as they are encountered. Neither is done by default, as it may be faster for your 3D software (e.g.
    Blender) to handle any issues or exceptions caused by such faces as they arise. Both types of problematic faces
    appear frequently in vanilla FLVER files, likely as an artifact of FromSoft's own mesh-splitting algorithm, and are
    almost certainly fine to remove.

    TODO: Currently optimized for DS1, but likely works for other games (if `FLVER` class is supported for them). Also
     only acts on the first vertex array in each submesh, as I haven't encountered any multi-buffer FLVERs yet.

    TODO: Big problem: this is currently deleting 'duplicate' faces that occur entirely across different materials. This
     could be fine for normal materials, but for materials with a mask prefix '#XX#', it's definitely wrong, as these
     materials frequently offer different options for the same face (e.g. different UVs and/or different textures).

        face, which is sourced directly from argument `submesh_material_indices` (which should have the same length as
        `flver.submeshes`) rather than using the original FLVER material index. This allows the definition of 'material'
        in the merged match to be set to match the caller's purposes, usually to preserve distinct submesh or face set
        properties (e.g. `is_bind_pose` or `use_backface_culling`) that may be different for submeshes that share the
        same FLVER material index.

        If `material_uv_layer_names` is given, it should be a list of list of UV layer names that correspond to the UV
        subarrays in the submesh's vertex buffer. This ensures that the UV maps across the entire merged FLVER are as
        compatible as possible, e.g. second texture UVs go into one map, lightmap UVs go into one map, etc. If not
        given, UV data will be assigned to default 'UVMap{i}' names created directly from the vertex array indices,
        which may lead to clashes and a more difficult 3D workflow (though no lost information, theoretically).

        If `merge_vertices` is False, the merged mesh will be created without any vertex merging, which is useful for
        importing FLVERs more quickly, but makes the models a lot more painful to edit, adjacent faces with different

        """FLVER models are optimized for rendering, and so they often have many duplicate vertices across submeshes,
        particularly along edges between faces that have different materials. This function attempts to re-optimize the
        mesh for modelling by merging identical vertices in `all_vertices` where appropriate.

        Returns vertex data (position and bone indices/weights), a 1D array mapping loops to that vertex data, and
        face (triangle) data (index triplets into loop data and material indices). All FLVER faces are triangles.

        The definition of 'identical vertices' is where the real difficulty lies here. Cases to consider:

            1. Two faces with different materials share one or two vertices. The shared vertices should definitely be
            merged. This is the easiest and most common case.

            2. Two faces with the same material share all three vertices and have the SAME OR SIMILAR vertex normals
            (say, within 90 degrees). These are genuine 'duplicate' faces and one of them should be deleted (the second
            one). There's no way for the game to render both of these at the same time, so they are likely an artifact
            of From's FLVER export process.

            3. Two faces with the same material share all three vertices and have DIFFERENT vertex normals (say, more
            than 90 degrees apart). These are NOT 'duplicate' faces because they are likely to be rendered from
            different sides. We should NOT merge these vertices, as Blender does not support two faces (which we do want
            here) sharing the same vertices.

            4. Two faces with different materials share all three vertices. If the materials have mask prefixes (in
            particular, DIFFERENT mask prefixes) like '#00#' and '#01#', then this is likely a genuine case of two faces
            that are used exclusively by different NPC Param mask configurations (e.g. two copies of a face mesh with
            different skin materials). We should NOT merge these vertices, regardless of normals. However, if the two
            meshes have the same mask prefix, then they will always be rendered simultaneously and we are basically in
            the same position as above, in which case we should check the normals again.

        In practice, we can simplify these by simply ensuring that faces with different material display masks are NEVER
        merged, which is probably desirable anyway.

        To classify these different cases, we unfortunately need to iterate over faces, rather than just vertices, and
        manually compare vertex normals (averaged over their loop normals) with `np.dot`. We also check the display mask
        mask of each material.

        `split_submesh_defs` must be a list of FLVER `Material` instances, appropriate layouts, and combined
        `Submesh/FaceSet` kwargs for each value that appears in `faces[:, 3]`. The merged mesh will be split based on
        these values (and maybe further split by bone maximum if `use_submesh_bone_indices == True`) and the created
        `Submesh` and `FaceSet` instances will take their materials, layouts, and miscellaneous kwargs from this list.

        If `uv_layer_names` is given for a `split_submesh_defs` element, it should be a list of list of UV layer
        names that indicate which keys in `MergedMesh.loop_uvs` are used by each corresponding submesh. This will
        ensure that each FLVER submesh vertex buffer can tightly pack only the global arrays that it uses: for
        example, a lightmapped one-texture submesh material may have UV layer names `['UVTexture0', 'UVLightmap']`,
        which will become its `uv_0` and `uv_1` vertex buffer fields, respectively. If `submesh_uv_layer_names` is
        not given, each submesh will simply look up UV keys 'UVMap{i}' in `MergedMesh.loop_uvs` for `i < n`,
        where `n` is the number of UVs it uses (determined by its given layout). This is fine, assuming that the
        `MergedMesh` was also constructed this way, with no UV layer names given.

        As with `MergedMesh.from_flver()`, the definition of 'material' here should comprise any reason that the mesh
        needs to be split, and `faces[3]` should be set accordingly. Two split submeshes may use the same FLVER
        material in `split_submesh_defs`, for example, yet have different `is_bind_pose` values or `face_sets[
        0].use_backface_culling` etc. The `FLVER` class will efficiently remove any duplicate FLVER materials or
        layouts when packed.

        If a submesh material index has no faces, it will be ignored.

        `is_bind_pose` must appear in each submesh kwargs dictionary, as it is used to determine bone index style.
        TODO: Still not 100% sure if there are any FLVERs that use 'bind pose' for some submeshes but not others. From
         memory, I found a few cut content objects or something, but only checked the bool and not the indices.

        If `unused_bone_indices_are_minus_one` is True, it will be assumed that the bone indices in
        `self.vertex_bone_indices` have been set to -1 when unused, rather than the FLVER standard of zero (which can be
        confused with actual use of bone 0 and requires weight inspection to confirm). This makes mesh splitting easier
        when submesh bone indices are used (with maximums); all the -1 indices will be replaced with zeroes in the final
        split submesh arrays.

        If `normal_tangent_dot_threshold` is less than 1.0, submesh loops will be considered equivalent if their
        normal and tangent (and bitangent) vectors' respective dot products are greater than this value. Note that this
        incurs a small performance penalty. Vertex POSITION must always be identical for two loops to be considered
        equivalent.

        If `max_submesh_vertex_count` is >0, an error will be raised if any submesh has more than this number of
        vertices. This is useful for ensuring that submeshes are not too large for the game to handle, as earlier games
        restrict face vertex indices to being 16-bit.
