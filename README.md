# soulstruct
Currently just my "EVS" (event scripting) compiler. 

EVS now supports Dark Souls 1, Bloodborne, and Dark Souls 3, including "event layers". See the examples and check out
all the vanilla EVS files, which are included.

(NOTE: The 'verbose' functionality (originally added to stay parallel with HotPocketRemix's event tools) is currently
not working because I wanted to focus on the decompiler, which is basically an editable verbose version anyway.)

More creator tools to come for other file formats.
